# DrupalHost

DrupalHost is a Drupal Installer plugin similar to the `laravel/installer` plugin.

## Installation

1. First, download the Drupal installer using Composer:

    ```shell
        composer global require ankitjain28may/drupalhost
    ```

2. Once it is installed, the `drupalhost` new command will create a fresh Drupal installation in the directory you specify.

    ```shell
        drupalhost new blog
    ```

**Note:** It takes the latest development branch i.e `8.x` of the [drupal-composer](https://github.com/drupal-composer/drupal-project) project.
